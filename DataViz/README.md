This is a data visualization analysis of crime hotspots on a map, crime comparison between two selected years, and changes in the pre-selected crime occurences.

### The crime hotspots map aims to answer the questions, "What are the geographic hotspots for crime in Seattle in a particular set of years and what are the most common categories of offenses in those areas?"
The downtown area of Seattle, specifically around Pike Place, tends to consistently be the biggest hotspot for crime throughout the years and property crimes appears to be the leading crime category.

### The crime comparison bar charts for two different years aims to answer the questions, "How have the number of offenses changed from one year to another and how has each Beat been affected by those changes?"
When comparing 2008 to 2022 crimes by offense, Burglary/Breaking & Entering and Destruction/Vandalism switched spots to 2nd and 3rd most common offense. Theft from motor vehicle offenses have decreased in number, however, Beat Q3 still remains the most common place of occurence for them.

### The changes in pre-selected crime occurences line graph aims to answer the questions, "How have the number of occurences of the leading crime offenses changed throughout the years, and what types of crimes are on the rise, on the fall, having significant changes, and have relatively stayed consistent?"
Offense changes throughout the years or lack thereof that have stuck out have been:
+ Significant increases to "Theft to Motor Vehicle Parts or Accessories" and "Identity Theft"
+ "Drug/Narcotic Violations" has had multiple significant drops in number of occurences
+ "Driving Under the Influence" has stayed relatively consistent from 2008 to 2022
