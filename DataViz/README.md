This is a data visualization analysis of crime hotspots on a map, crime comparison between two selected years, and changes in the pre-selected crime occurences.

+ The crime hotspots map aims to answer the questions, "What are the geographic hotspots for crime in Seattle in a particular set of years and what are the most common categories of offenses in those areas?"

+ The crime comparison bar charts for two different years aims to answer the questions, "How have the number of offenses changed from one year to another and how has each Beat been affected by those changes?"

+ The changes in pre-selected crime occurences line graph aims to answer the questions, "How have the number of occurences of the leading crime offenses changed throughout the years, and what types of crimes are on the rise, on the fall, having significant changes, and have relatively stayed consistent?"
